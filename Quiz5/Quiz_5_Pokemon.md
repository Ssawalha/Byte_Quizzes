## Quiz: Pokemon Weight Lookup

Create an html web page with an input field and a button and an output area. 
You will create a script to look up the weight of a character from Nintendo's
Pokemon using an api. Your answer should be three files: 

`index.html, script.js, and style.css`

The user will input the name of a monster from Nintendo's Pokemon games and
your page will respond with that character's weight.

You will need to read input from an `<input>` tag, fetch an api endpoint, 
read a value from the json and then update an `<div>` or other tag's contents 
with the value.

Use this API:

https://pokeapi.co/

Documentation

https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html

Use this endpoint:

GET /api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/

Style your page so that there is spacing between the elements and the output
uses a different font than the default.
